## What are draft posts?

This is an example of a draft post. Draft posts aren't included when publishing your site.

This is great for authoring work in progress content, or hiding content that shouldn't be available at the current time.

This is some more text for testing the cas website functionailty:

* Dashes turn into bullet points
* **Bold** can be achieved via double asterisks
* _Italics_ via single asterisks
* _underscores_ also work
* **For bold too**

Three dashes/underscores for a horizontal line.
